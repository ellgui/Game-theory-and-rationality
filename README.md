# Game-theory-and-rationality
The aim of this course is to give an introduction to game theory and evolutionary models within the field, in order to inspire and engage the students so that they can identify and explore game-theoretic dilemmas or situations during the studies as well as in their future work-life. This is achieved through examining basic game-theoretic concepts including the concept of rationality. The students, typically at the end of their undergraduate studies, are tasked individually as well as in group with acquiring knowledge about a series of game-theoretic applications. We focus on the effects of individual rationality on collective outcomes, as well as the resulting behavior of agents with different strategies in a large population. We cover theory of general principles of rational action and examine known limitations on how well this describes human behavior in reality. Secondary aims include getting hands-on experience of modelling in a game-theoretic context as well as training in reading and presenting scientific articles. The course offers students a possibility to deepen their understanding of their subject area through project-based studies of applications within their respective field.
